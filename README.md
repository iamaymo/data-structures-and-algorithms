# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in [your programming language, e.g., C++, Python, Java]. It serves as a learning resource for understanding and working with essential data structures. Each implementation is well-documented with explanations and example usage.

## 📌 Included Data Structures

### 1️⃣ Singly Linked List  
A linear data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence.  
✔ Efficient for dynamic memory allocation.  
✔ Useful for applications like symbol tables and adjacency lists.  

### 2️⃣ Doubly Linked List  
A linked list where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes.  
✔ Allows traversal in both directions.  
✔ Used in scenarios like browser history and undo operations.  

### 3️⃣ Circular Linked List  
A variation of linked lists where the last node links back to the first, forming a loop.  
✔ Eliminates the need for NULL pointers.  
✔ Commonly used in scheduling tasks like Round-robin scheduling.  

### 4️⃣ Stack  
A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure.  
✔ Supports push, pop, and peek operations.  
✔ Used in function call stacks, undo-redo mechanisms, and expression evaluation.  

### 5️⃣ Queue  
A First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure.  
✔ Supports enqueue and dequeue operations.  
✔ Commonly used in task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search.
